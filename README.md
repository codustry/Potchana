# Potchana
An open source Thai-based dictionary plug-in for Mac.

The name “Potchana” comes from a full name **“Potchananukrom (พจนานุกรม)”** which means dictionary in Thai language. It is thai-based dictionary plug-in for dictionary.app which means it’s translate from and to Thai from languages around the world.

**Potchana** was designed to works on dictionary.app which developed by Apple so its only works on Macintosh computer. We are using a bunch of database of dictionary from many sources in different formats. We translate that format and make it clean. Then we create a installer which include all of the languages for user to install dictionary on their computer easily.

The problem that make us want to do Thai-based dictionary for Mac is because many of us are users of StarDict in Linux and they have great dictionaries but in Mac there is none who can get these language on Mac. The only dictionary that works but not as good as it should be is developed by NECTEC called “Lexitron” which provides Thai-English & English-Thai dictionaries.
